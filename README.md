## PH 421 Photonics: Project (2020)

### **Instructor:** Professor Anshuman Kumar, Physics Department, IIT Bombay

Total strength is 62, so we will have 15 groups of 4 people each and 1 group of 2 people.

Requirements:

- A 1 hour long **pre-recorded** presentation by each team, which should be made available to the entire class on microsoft teams before your live presentation date
- A 15 minute shorter **live** presentation during the class:
  - Giving a broader picture of the work
  - Explaining the specific calculations/plots you reproduced
  - Live iPython notebook demo reproducing the plots
- In lieu of a traditional project report, an [executable paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00403-4) (iPython notebook is strongly encouraged) reproducing the calculations/plots/derivations needs to be supplied to the instructor for evaluation
- In both the presentations as well as the executable paper, **details of the contributions of individual group members** to the project should be clearly spelt out.
- Evaluation is based on the following criteria:
  - Understanding of the topic: breadth and depth (eg. via reading cross-references)
  - Quality of presentation (eg. motivation, breaking down the problem, conclusion)
  - Reproducing parts of the paper (i.e. your executable paper (iPython notebook) demo) -- this component has the highest weightage

\* means that some prior exposure to quantum optics will help in the project
